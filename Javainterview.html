asymptotic (渐进的) runtime, or big O time

 (big 0): In academia, big O describes an upper bound on the time
 (big omega): In academia, 0 is the equivalent concept but for lower bound. 
 (big theta): In academia, e means both O and 0, That is, an algorithm is 0(N) if it is both O(N) and
 0(N). 0 gives a tight bound on runtime.
